React is a javascript library for building user interfaces
React makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler
React is all about "Components"
Because all user interfaces in the end are made up of components

Why Components?
Reusability
Separation of concerns
Don't repeat yourself
Don't do too many things in one and the same place (function)
Split a big chunk of code into multiple smaller functions


What is a "Components"?

How is A Component Built?
HTML + CSS + Javascript => React

React & Components
React allow you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML and javascript ( and CSS)
|-> Declarative Approach -> Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JavaScript DOM Instructions
Build your own, custom HTML Elements
